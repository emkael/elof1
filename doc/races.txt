== Race selection ==
Races included in the standings:
 * all World Championship of Drivers races run to Formula One regulations (so no Indianapolis 500 in the 50s) from 1950 to 1980
 * all World Championship of Drivers races run to Formula Two regulations in 1952-53
 * all Formula One World Championship races since 1981
 * all non-championship races run to contemporary or nearly contemporary Formula One regulations since 1950, apart from national championship series (so Races of Champions, International Trophies, Bologna Sprints or non-championship Grands Prix are included, but Aurora F1, Tasman Series or South African F1 races are excluded)
 * some of the 1952-53 non-championship Formula Two races (including these with substantial WDC drivers appearence, such as French Formula Two Championship races and some other arbitrary races)
 * all post-War, pre-1950 Grandes Épreuves races (which includes some 1946 races from before F1 regulations and excludes majority of F1-compliant races from 1947 onwards)
 * races with mixed formula entries (e.g. F1/F2 or F1/FLibre) are separated by class and only F1 class (and F2 class in 1952-53) is scored

Race importance factor:
 * WCoD and FOWC race importance constitutes 100% of base value
 * all other races get 50% of base value
 * qualifying sessions get 10% of the value for respective race
 * all races of the same category are scored identically, even if the race has been red-flagged before what would be full points situation

Heats and aggregates:
 * for multi-heat races with bracket-style heats and a final heats count as qualifying sessions and the final count as a race (except for Bologna Sprints, in which every heat from the full bracket get qualifying importance)
 * for multi-heat races with aggregate-style standings the initial grid counts as qualifying and the aggregate results count as a race
